# Expense_Tracker
 
This is a Java-based Expense Tracker where a personal expense can easily be tracked and managed. As with any equivalent tool, it provides the usual basic functionalities to add new expenses, view all recorded expenses, calculate the total amount spent, and search for expenses based on descriptions. By the end of this, the user will be able to generate weekly and monthly expense reports on his spending patterns.

The tracker is also able to set expense targets for the week and month, so when expenses are at or over 90% of these targets, it will start giving users a warning. It allows the deletion of expenses, while data persistence has been achieved through file storage. It reads and writes the expense data in CSV files to make sure that the users' expenses and targets are saved even after sessions are closed.
